# YugI-Monster-Love




<h1>Yugi to be my sweetheart!!!</h1>


<p>What is love? Will this question ever be answered?</p>


<pThe Yugi-Monster-Love game will use an open API that does not require an APIkey. I will ttry to make this game similar to other popular dating sims, while trying to maintain my own personality. The sim will have a host(Yugi) unless I change my mind. he may or may not act in a typical fashion based on his anime persona. I am sorry if this turns anyone away from the game. The game will consist of a basic "personality test" that is administered by the host and will pair the user with 2-5 possible matches. This is for fun and is not to be taken seriously, Jake.
</p>






<h2>Pseudo game logic-</h2>

<ul>
<li>a set number of monster cards will be given a "compatibility score"</li>

<li>a test will be given to the user to compare their score with each monster</li>

<li>if user score is equal to or within a certain amount they will match with the monster they are closest to with their compatibility score</li>

<li>the host reaction will change based on the crrent score and the question being asked(hopefully).</li>
</ul>
